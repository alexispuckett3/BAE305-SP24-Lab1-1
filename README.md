Project Summary: 

The goal of this lab is to get us familiar with electrical components, such as resistors and capacitors, along with oscilloscopes, multimeters, and function generators. We used the digital multimeter (DMM) to measure the resistance of the resistors, the capacitance of the capacitors, and the voltage of the voltage sources. We then used the oscilloscope and different methods to measure the amplitude and frequency of the voltage source with a resistor. Finally, we changed the frequency and amplitude to see how the sinusoidal wave on the oscilloscope changes and how the value on the DMM changes. 

Through our work, we found that the labeled resistances were very similar to the resistances we measured using the DMM, and all except one were within the tolerance range. All of the labeled capacitances were very close to the capacitances we measured, and the measured voltages were close to the expected voltages of the function generator.

Results:

Labeled Resistance vs Measured Resistance With DMM
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
|   Labeled Resistance    | 120 k&Omega;   |  3.3 M&Omega;  |  2 k&Omega;    |  22 &Omega;   |
|   Measured Resistance   | 120.4 k&Omega; |  3.5 M&Omega;  |  2.03 k&Omega; |  23.7 &Omega; |

Do the resistors fall within their tolerance?


Labeled Capacitance vs Measured Capacitance With DMM
| Variable | Value | Value | Value | Value |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
|   Labeled Capacitance  | 100 &mu;F   |  10 &mu;F     |  Blue       |  Yellow  |
|   Measured Capacitance | 101.6 &mu;F |  10.19 &mu;F  |  10.4 nF    |  1.3 nF  |

Do the insturments agree with the expected value?

Does the polarity affect the measurement of the electrolytic capacitor?


Labeled Voltage vs Measured Voltage With DMM
| Variable | Value | Value | Value | Value |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
|   Labeled Voltage                    | 1.5 V   |  7.0 V   |  12 V    | 
|   Measured Voltage at 1-20VDC Output | 1.49 V  |  7.0 V   |  12.01 V |  
|  Measured Voltage at 3.3/5VDC Output | 5.18 V  |  5.18 V  |  5.18 V  |  
|  Measured Voltage at 3.3/5VDC Output | 11.98 V |  11.99 V |  11.99 V |  

Do the instruments agree with eachother? Why/why not?
