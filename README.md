Project Summary: 

The goal of this lab is to get us familiar with electrical components, such as resistors and capacitors, along with oscilloscopes, multimeters, and function generators. We used the digital multimeter (DMM) to measure the resistance of the resistors, the capacitance of the capacitors, and the voltage of the voltage sources. We then used the oscilloscope and different methods to measure the amplitude and frequency of the voltage source with a resistor. Finally, we changed the frequency and amplitude to see how the sinusoidal wave on the oscilloscope changes and how the value on the DMM changes. 

Through our work, we found that the labeled resistances were very similar to the resistances we measured using the DMM, and all except one were within the tolerance range. All of the labeled capacitances were very close to the capacitances we measured, and the measured voltages were close to the expected voltages of the function generator.

Results:

Labeled Resistance vs Measured Resistance With DMM
| Variable | Value | Value | Value | Value |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
|   Labeled Resistance    | 120 k&Omega;   |  3.3 M&Omega;  |  2 k&Omega;    |  22 &Omega;   |
|   Measured Resistance   | 120.4 k&Omega; |  3.5 M&Omega;  |  2.03 k&Omega; |  23.7 &Omega; |

Do the resistors fall within their tolerance?
All of the resistors do fall within tolerance except for the 22 Ohms resistor. This resistor is above the tolerance that is assigned by color. 

Labeled Capacitance vs Measured Capacitance With DMM
| Variable | Value | Value | Value | Value |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|
|   Labeled Capacitance  | 100 &mu;F   |  10 &mu;F     |  Blue       |  Yellow  |
|   Measured Capacitance | 101.6 &mu;F |  10.19 &mu;F  |  10.4 nF    |  1.3 nF  |

Do the instruments agree with the expected value?
The instruments do agree with their labeled capacitance and expected value. 

Does the polarity affect the measurement of the electrolytic capacitor?
Yes, the polarity slightly affects the measurement of the electrolytic capacitor. With this being said, there is already very little difference between the measured value of the capacitors and the expected values. 

Labeled Voltage vs Measured Voltage With DMM
| Variable | Value | Value | Value | 
|:---:|---|---|---|
|   Labeled Voltage                    | 1.5 V   |  7.0 V   |  12 V    | 
|   Measured Voltage at 1-20VDC Output | 1.49 V  |  7.0 V   |  12.01 V |  
|  Measured Voltage at 3.3/5VDC Output | 5.18 V  |  5.18 V  |  5.18 V  |  
|  Measured Voltage at 3.3/5VDC Output | 11.98 V |  11.99 V |  11.99 V |  

Do the instruments agree with each other? Why/why not?
Yes, the instruments agree with each other, but they differ to a degree. There is just a slight difference between the expected voltages and the measured voltages. Some of the voltage is lost due to the resistance in the leads which causes a slight difference to be seen.

Amplitude and Frequency of Sinusoidal Wave Using Different Methods
| Variable | Value | Value | 
|:---:|---|---|
|   Method           | Amplitude  |  Frequency |  
|   Counting Squares | 6 V        |            | 
|   Movable Cursors  | 6 V        |  2.22 kHz  | 
|  Measure Features  | 6 V        |  2.28 kHz  | 
|  Fluke DMM         | 4.167 V    |  2.29 kHz  | 

Do the instruments agree? Why/why not?
Yes, they are very close, but there is a little difference in their values. Our measurements using the oscilloscope differ because we used different methods to collect this data and there may have been human error, this could include not having the lines in the correct spot which has the potential to lead to incorrect values. The DMM value is different from the oscilloscope values because it shows us the RMS value of the voltage which is the amplitude divided by the square root of 2, instead of giving us the actual amplitude.  

Change the frequency and amplitude and observe what happens to the sinusoidal wave and the value on the DMM.
When we decrease the voltage from the function generator, the amplitude on the oscilloscope decreases, and the RMS value on the DMM decreases and vice versa.  
When we increase the frequency dramatically, the amplitude and the RMS value decrease. 
When we decrease the frequency dramatically, the amplitude and the RMS value decrease.
